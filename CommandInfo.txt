command that got it done cat P_file.txt | grep -E t?o+m?o?r?ro+w+| grep -E g?o+o+d+| grep 1>>CommandInfo.txt
so the p just prints the line that was matched cat P_file.txt| sed -n '/tomorrow/ p'
the s in sed like s'/thing/thingtosub/'

use caret (^) for beginning of line $ end of line or match at end of line 
get all lines that start with T grep ^[T] P_file.txt>>CommandsInfo.txt
note that these are pertaining to the start of a new line
like this will give you lines that end in g
grep g
notice that the lines end in g
$ denotes the end of the line
I keep overwriting this file so that is bad 24
so the dot is important that last one gave every line that contained the test writing with anything before it
But cant figure out how to give it starting characters then the dot then the ending characters

 curl allows you to download files from the web using url link to the file curl -O https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/53/iris.zip
so what do we haver here: -oE /w+ makes each word a line, then uniq counts each word and the -c parameter gives the count, sort -nr, the n is numeric and the r is reverse.        COMMAND:             curl  https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72776/pg72776.txt| grep -oE w+|sort|uniq -c|sort -nr
curl without the -o parameter just prints the contents of the file to std output

r is a sperator in awk
fs is field seperator
Prints only the 3rd column awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS=,} NR>1 {print }' movies.csv
sed is string edition 
 this prints the file without the header awk 'NR>1 {print -bash}' movies.csv
so the dot is important that last one gave every line that contained the test writing with anything before it
